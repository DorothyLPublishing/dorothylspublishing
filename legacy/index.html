  <h1>Publisher’s Foreword</h1>
  <h2>The Legacy Standard in Indigenous Literature and Thought</h2>

  <p>There are moments in publishing when the written word transcends industry and becomes an instrument of restoration. At <em>The Legacy Standard in Indigenous Literature and Thought</em>, we believe literature is not a product of time, but a reflection of alignment — between truth, art, and purpose.</p>

  <p>We write and publish for those who overstand the weight of their words — those who know that culture is not merely recorded, it is architected. Each page we bring into the world is a structure of integrity; every author we stand beside is a builder of intellectual sovereignty.</p>

  <p>Our work exists at the intersection of story and strategy — where Indigenous wisdom meets global innovation. We publish not as an act of rebellion but as an act of continuity, weaving new fabric through old roots, restoring voice to legacy and structure to thought.</p>

  <blockquote>Legacy is not inherited — it is cultivated.</blockquote>

  <p>Through our editorial works, we seek to unify a fragmented history — weaving the enduring stories of resilience into a modern standard of elegance, intellect, and innovation.</p>

  <p>Our mission is clear: to expand the conversation, to uphold the craft, and to build a future where literary excellence defines the standard — not for one people, but for all descendants of brilliance.</p>

  <p>We are <strong>The Legacy Standard</strong> — and our commitment is to publish for Overstanding.</p>

    <h2>Legacy Reading List</h2>
    <p>
      At Dorothy L’s Publishing, we believe legacy is not inherited — it is cultivated.  
      These works have been selected as entry points into Overstanding — the practice of seeing ourselves and our stories in full dimension.  
      This list will grow as I read, learn, and evolve — and I invite you to journey with me as we build together.  
      — Dorothy L. Reddick
